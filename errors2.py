# This example program is meant to demonstrate errors.
 
# There are some errors in this program. Run the program, look at the error messages, and find and fix the errors.

# enclose all strings in quotes
animal = "Lion"
animal_type = "cub"
number_of_teeth = 16 # no quotes needed for integer 

# implemented f for string formatting
full_spec = f"This is a {animal}. It is a {animal_type} and it has {number_of_teeth} teeth."

# parentheses added for the print function
print(full_spec)
